Hi, I’m John Groos!
I am currently a student enrolled Carleton College.
I am double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics.
I enjoy coding and number theory and this github (WILL, it's a WIP) contains a few of
my projects, both from school and outside of it.

Thanks for looking at my github,
you can reach me at johncgroos@gmail.com.
